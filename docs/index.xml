- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://docs.hugoblox.com/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://docs.hugoblox.com/writing-markdown-latex/).
Further event details, including page elements such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page. -->
&lt;p>When HCI was launched as a field, cognitive models were supposed to serve a central role in design, evaluation, and theory-formation. However, despite a decade of promising progress, that vision was never realized. Why did it fail and what could we do better now that we have modern machine learning methods? In this talk, I discuss computational rationality, a computational theory of interaction that combines theoretical principles in cognitive sciences with machine learning in a new way. I review the key theoretical insights and advances in applications in HCI. I conclude with a discussion of where we are with cognitive models and what we need to solve to make them more broadly applicable.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Human-Computer Interaction Top Conference - ACM CHI 2023, announced the acceptance results this morning. Seven papers from our APEX group were accepted. The first-author of six papers are PhD students supervised by Prof. Mingming Fan, five of whom are first-year PhD students. Congratulations to the students and collaborators in the group! Our accepted work contributes to two major domains: 1) improving the accessibility of technology to the elderly and the disablabled people, working towards the broad goal of information accessibility; 2) exploring theories and methods of intelligent user experience analysis, and improving the shortcomings of traditional user experience analysis methods in human-computer interaction. Specific project details will be shared later!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>/admin/config.yml</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/admin/config.yml</guid><description/></item><item><title/><link>/people/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/people/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
